    "Machine Learning is the discipline that tries to produce meaningful outputs from a computer without explicitly programming an algorithm to follow. For example, email spam classifiers and product recommendation systems are based on Machine Learning. Machine Learning purports to construct models of a phenomena by studying a variety of scenarios, and then use these models to predict an output response to future inputs. In this course we will study the most commonly used Machine Learning techniques, their implementation and applications. We will also learn (at some intuitive level) the mathematical and statistical principles underlying these techniques."
